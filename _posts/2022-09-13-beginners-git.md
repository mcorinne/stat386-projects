So, you're interested in learning git, but you don't know where to start? Here's some simple first steps!

### Step 1: 
#### Install git on your local machine
First, install [Homebrew](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
Then, in your terminal, write:
`brew install git`
Now you should be good to go!

### Step 2: 
#### Make the directory that you want to initialize git in
`mkdir myproject`

### Step 3A: 
#### Initialize git repo on local machine!
First, make sure you step into your directory
`cd myproject`
Now you can initialize with the command
`git init`

### Step 3B: 
#### Initialize using clone
Another way to set up git repo locally is to clone and existing repo from a remote location. You do this by saying
`git clone <url>`

Congratulations! You've initialized git on your local machine!
