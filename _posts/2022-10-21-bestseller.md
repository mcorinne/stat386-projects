# Introduction
Working at a bookstore, it's important to know which books are going to sell. The New York Times Bestsellers list is one of the most authorative rankings of bookselling out there, and luckily you can customize your own book listing depending on what information you want to know. On its list, the New York Times provides how many weeks the book has been on its list, the publisher, and the author. This information is helpful to me to get an idea of what books are going to be more likely to sell, what publishers and authors I should buy from, etc. It could be helpful to you in knowing what books you want to read! Let's begin.

# Step 1: Get Your API Key
In order to get your NYT API key, you'll need to start a developer's account (good news, it's free!). You can do that now by following [this link](https://developer.nytimes.com/accounts/create). All you'll need is your first and last name, email, and a password that you create.
